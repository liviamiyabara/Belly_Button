# Belly_Button

## Overview
Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. A researcher in a microbiology laboratory conducted a study to map the bacterial species that can be found in the belly button, also known as navel. 
The deliverable is a HTML page where the user can select a specific individual from the study and check the dynamic charts with the "Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found", the "Belly Button Washing Frequency" and the "Bacteria Cultures per Sample".
